Database Data Prediction using Ridge Regression
Overview
This application leverages Ridge Regression to predict the "slack" in route data based on features from place and route timing tables. The project connects to a PostgreSQL database, fetches data, trains a Ridge Regression model, and provides predictions for test data.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Streamlit
pandas
scikit-learn
psycopg2
You can install the dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn psycopg2
Database Configuration
The application connects to a PostgreSQL database using the following credentials (customize these as necessary in the DB_CONFIG section of the script):

Database: demo
User: postgres
Password: root
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Make sure that the PostgreSQL database is running, and the necessary tables are present.

Steps to Use
1. Fetch Training Data
Select two tables from the database: one containing place timing data and another containing route timing data.
Click the “Fetch Training Data” button to load the data into the app.
2. Train the Model
The app uses the fetched place and route data to train a Ridge Regression model.
After training, the R-squared score of the model is displayed as an indicator of model performance.
3. Fetch Test Data and Predict
Select the test data table from the database.
Click "Fetch Test Data and Predict" to generate predictions using the trained model.
The predictions, along with the actual slack values, are displayed.
You can download the results as a CSV file.
Columns in the Data
The following columns are used from the tables:

Place Data:
fanout
netcount
netdelay
invdelay
bufdelay
seqdelay
skew
combodelay
wirelength
slack (target column)
Route Data:
beginpoint
endpoint
slack (target column)
Output
A table containing:

beginpoint and endpoint
place_slack (Slack value from place data)
actual_route_slack (Slack value from route data)
predicted_route_slack (Predicted Slack from the model)
A download button to save the results in CSV format.

Troubleshooting
If the app encounters any issues while fetching data from the database, training the model, or generating predictions, error messages will be displayed with information on what went wrong.
